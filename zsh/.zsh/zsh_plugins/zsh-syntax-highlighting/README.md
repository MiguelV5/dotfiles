zsh-syntax-highlighting
=======================

**[Fish shell][fish]-like syntax highlighting for [Zsh][zsh].**

*Requirements: zsh 4.3.11+.*

[fish]: https://fishshell.com/
[zsh]: https://www.zsh.org/

This package provides syntax highlighting for the shell zsh.  It enables
highlighting of commands whilst they are typed at a zsh prompt into an
interactive terminal.  This helps in reviewing commands before running
them, particularly in catching syntax errors.

**Note to self**
Kept here for reminding purposes only, as it is an external plugin.
